# Javadoc

You can lookup supported Javadoc with the bot. We recommend using the slash commands since they provide autocompletion for the available docs.

Here's an example:

![Javadoc Example](/assets/javadoc/javadoc_example.png){ loading=lazy }

You can view the supported Javadocs via `/alldocs`:

![Alldocs Example](/assets/javadoc/alldocs_example.png){ loading=lazy }

Currently we are supporting 5 different Javadocs. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/bankobotv14/BankoBot/issues/new) to add another.
